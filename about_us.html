        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Eden Homes is on a mission to create hope-filled, safe, and family-like group homes for children in need. Founded by Liv Holguin, our journey began with a powerful moment in a special needs and foster care group home. Witnessing a resident's heartbreak when his own mother decided to give up her rights, Liv was inspired to make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>Join us in creating a brighter future for these vulnerable children. Together, we can change the group home culture and make a lasting impact. Help us reach our goal of opening our doors by Spring 2023 by purchasing our LOVED t-shirts, with 100% of the proceeds contributing to our cause. Discover how Eden Homes stands out from other group home agencies and become a part of our transformative journey.
